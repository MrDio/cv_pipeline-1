# Copmputer Vision Pipeline for robotic percetion

Computer Vision Pipeline for robotic perception tasks. This repoitory integrates am [Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/sd-maskrcnn) to perform scene segmentation based on rdbd data. Furthermore a [Fully Convolutional Grasp Quality](https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/gqcnn) approach by Uni Berkeley is used to propose and evaluate grasp points for parallel jaw and suction cup gripper.
